<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Animal pollination accounts for 35% of our global food production and 80% of wild plants rely on insect pollination, most of which is provided by bees. Bees are declining dramatically in numbers, and yet we can only assess the status for a fraction of the 20,000 known bee species. The loss of pollination ecosystem services by bees could lead to a biosecurity collapse for both natural and agricultural ecosystems. Recent anthropogenic loss of biodiversity and changes in species distributions are already affecting our economy. Our ability to respond to the global pollinator decline crisis requires historic and integrated data to track how species distributions and flight phenology are changing over time, monitor the spread of non-native bee species, elucidate historical trends in abundance over decadal timescales, and monitor the future trajectory of invasive species, species of conservation concern, and agriculturally important species. The Extended Bee Network will fill a knowledge gap in addressing these issues through the digitization of historic specimens, data integration, and partnering with bee researchers and government agencies to provide open datasets for policy, research, and education.</p>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong> We are poised to launch the most comprehensive insect biodiversity digitization to date. Our coordinated effort involves ~80 collections and will mobilize 75% of bee specimens in US collections, leading to an average of 1,500 records per species.</p>

<p>The Extended Bee Network will:
1) Implement LightningBug, a semi-automated robotic system that will extract label data and take 3D images of specimens, increasing the rate of digitization at our larger collections.
2) Digitize occurrence data from 3 million new records in addition to the existing 3 million bee records already digitized. This will provide near-complete specimen data from US collections for a major clade of insects (6 million total specimens).
3) Produce 3D and 2D image suites for 5,000 bee species for a computer vision-based identification and a trait library.
4) Integrate datasets and create emergent datasets with our specimen-based data, including: community science inventories (iNaturalist), monitoring datasets, genomic, phenological, phylogenetic, trait, and biotic interaction data.</p>

<p class="mb-5"><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> Bees are a model group for promoting broader impacts in research, education, and outreach. In collaboration with the currently- funded USDA RCN, we will create a US National Native Bee Monitoring Plan, thus engaging broadly with >50 bee researchers. Additionally, we will integrate with the Global Bee Genetics Initiative (USDA-ARS) whose goal is to complete DNA barcoding for all US bee species, Global Biotic Interactions Project, and Open Tree of Life. As public interest in bees is increasing, many partners and museums already host bee education and training programs at various levels (museum staff, undergraduate/graduate education, K-12, and continuing) and these events and resources will be promoted through Big-Bee. Participating institutions developing undergraduate course materials that involve examination of bee specimens or use of data derived from specimens will contribute lesson plans to BLUE (Biodiversity Literacy for Undergraduate Education). Network museums will regularly contribute to the syndicated college radio show and podcast, The Buzz, produced at UCSB.</p>
